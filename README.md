## Contributing

This is an npm workspace, with a core package that shares data models and some
UI between extensions.

-   You can use `npm run watch` to watch _everything_, or, for example,
    `npm run watch:flame`, to only watch changes to the flame graph extension.
-   There's a launch config that runs all extensions.
-   `npm run compile`, again with scopes like `compile:flame`, create static
    compilations of various packages.
